Iris Machine Learning Models
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models applied to the Iris dataset sourced from Kaggle. The Iris dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning, comprising measurements of iris flowers' sepal and petal dimensions across three species. The implemented models include:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Random Forest
k-Nearest Neighbors
Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, with each sample containing four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of iris, with three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
